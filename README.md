# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage was created for bootcamp students like myself to keep track of the many notes that come with learning how to code. It was purposely built as a webstie in order to practice the notes that were put into the guide. This website currently focuses on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
